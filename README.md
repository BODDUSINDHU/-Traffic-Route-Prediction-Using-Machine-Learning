# -Traffic-Route-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning-based system to predict optimal routes in urban traffic using *SVM, **Decision Tree, and **Random Forest* models. The system analyzes historical and real-time data to reduce congestion and improve travel efficiency.

## ðŸ§  Abstract

This project aims to solve urban traffic congestion by predicting best routes using ML techniques. It uses real-time and historical traffic data to offer dynamic, accurate route suggestions.
